Connect module to power bus using provided ribbon cable, aligning the red stripe correctly. Secure module in your case with included screws. Controls and Inputs Audio Inputs (IN1, IN2, IN3): Accepts AC signals. Features attenuator and drive control (distortion past 1 o'clock). Frequency Modulation (FM) Input: Connects to frequency modulation control attenuverter. Acts as fine-tune for cutoff frequency (1-octave range) when unplugged. Frequency (FREQ) Input: 1-octave-per-volt control over cutoff frequency (stays in tune up to 4 octaves). Temperature drift uncompensated. Resonance (RES) Input and Control: Controls feedback and can drive filter into self-oscillation. CV is summed with control voltage. Resonance is sensitive to signal input levels, if you hear no change before self-oscillation try attenuating the signal. Mode Input and Control: CV input of 5V for morphing between BP, LP, NOTCH18/6, and HP modes. In Scanner mode, boosts selected mode's input channel volume. Level Input: Controls end-chain VCA's level. Slider attenuates CV signal, normalized to 5V when unplugged. Filter Type Switch: Selects between Morph Mixer and Scanner filter types. Features Morph Mixer: The 3 inputs are unity mixed and routed into the filter core depending on mode position. Blend between filter response modes (BP, LP, Notch, HP). Scanner: Frequency control sets wave position. IN1 Signal routes to Lowpass response. Signal will be fully open 5 o'clock position of frequency knob IN2 Signal routes to Bandpass response. (highpass 6 + lowpass 18) The signal is most pronounced near the centre position of frequency knob. IN3 Signal routes to Highpass response. Signal will be fully open 7 o'clock position of frequency knob Boosts selected mode's input channel volume. Filter responses: 18db Low pass 12db Band pass 6db High pass A notch filter can be achieved by positioning the mode knob between LP and HP modes. Tips and Tricks Use FM input for pitch modulations. Drive controls add warmth and character. Achieve self-oscillation by increasing resonance. In Scanner mode, use different signals in each input for dynamic transitions. Experiment with unconventional CV connections and modulation sources. Troubleshooting Ensure secure power bus connection and correct power supply. Check all connections and correct jacks. Power-cycle Eurorack case if module isn't functioning. Hot audio signals will sometimes cause the filter to latch in scan type and bp modes. Reduce the signal level with attenuator if this happens.
